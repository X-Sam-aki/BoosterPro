Here are several recommendations to enhance my application:

UI/UX Improvements
Consistent Hero Sections - Your FAQ and Contact hero sections have similar styling. Consider creating a reusable PageHero component that accepts title, description, and background as props.

Loading States - Add loading indicators when fetching data or during page transitions to improve user experience.

Animation Enhancements - Add subtle animations when users interact with cards or buttons to make the UI feel more responsive.

Mobile Navigation - Ensure the mobile navigation experience is smooth with a hamburger menu for smaller screens.

Feature Enhancements
User Dashboard Personalization - Allow users to customize their dashboard view by rearranging cards or setting growth goals.

FAQ Search Improvements - Add highlighting of search terms in FAQ results or implement fuzzy search for better user experience.

Social Media Integration - Add direct integration with social media platforms so users can authorize and manage their accounts directly.

Service Comparison Tool - Create a comparison page where users can see features and benefits of different service tiers side by side.

Technical Improvements
Code Splitting - Implement lazy loading for routes to improve initial load time.

Error Boundaries - Add error boundaries around key components to prevent the whole app from crashing if one component fails.

Automated Testing - Consider adding unit and integration tests for critical features.

Theme Customization - Implement a theme provider to allow users to switch between light and dark mode.

Data Caching Strategy - Implement a robust caching strategy for API responses to reduce unnecessary network requests.

Components to Refactor
Dashboard.tsx (206 lines) - This file is quite large. Consider breaking it into smaller components like:

DashboardHeader
GrowthProgressCards
StatOverview
QuickActions
RecentOrdersSection
Services.tsx - Split into smaller components for better maintainability.

HeroSection.tsx - Extract stat cards into a separate component.
